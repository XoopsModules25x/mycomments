    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4>

    <p class="even">With this Xoops module, your users can keep a track of their received and sent comments.<br /> <br />
        The module can :<br /> <br />
        . display received comments by user<br /> <br />
        . display sent comments by user<br /> <br />
        . display the above per module<br /> <br />
        . include comments on your site search<br /> <br />
        . display a block with the last commented items (not last comments)<br /> <br />
        . etc

        </p>

    <h4 class="odd">Install/uninstall</h4>

    <p class="even">No special measures necessary, follow the standard installation process â€“
    extract the module folder into the ../modules directory. Install the
    module through Admin -> System Module -> Modules.<br /> <br />
    Detailed instructions on installing modules are available in the
    <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/xoops/xoops-operations-guide/" target="_blank">XOOPS Operations Manual</a> <br /> <br />

        This module makes use of plugins. Without plugins there will be nothing to see.
        Available plugins are located at /mycomments/plugins.<br /> <br />
    </p>

    <h4 class="odd">Developing plugins</h4>

    <p class="even">Plugins are based on the "What's new" module plugins. With little effort you can adapt them to work with mycomments.
    If you are a module developer you can include your plugins under yourmodule/include/mycomments.plugin.php<br /> <br />
    The plugin should also work for modules that use XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.<br /> <br />

    You can send your plugin to lusopoemas@gmail.com if you want me to add it to mycomments/plugins folder.<br /> <br /></p>
